# Dotfiles of sesonntag
Collection of my dotfiles

Git clone this repo to any dir and symlink the necessary files into the home dir. Take care that in some cases the installation of software creates new dotfiles and overrides/backups existing dotfiles. Thus, always install the corresponding software first, then symlink the dotfile to the home dir.
The repo is always held up to date. However, some of the files are changed more frequent than others. Especially the my vim and emacs configs are often undergoing changes.
